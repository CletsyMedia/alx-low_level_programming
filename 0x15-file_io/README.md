# C - File I/O(Input/Output)

File I/O (Input/Output) in C is a way to read data from files (input) or write data to files (output). It allows you to interact with files on your computer's disk, enabling your programs to store and retrieve data from external sources. In C, file I/O is handled through the use of standard library functions.
