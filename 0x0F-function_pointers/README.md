# C - Function Pointers

C function pointers are variables that store addresses of functions. They enable dynamic invocation of functions, allowing programs to call different functions at runtime. By using function pointers, functions can be passed as arguments or stored in data structures, facilitating flexible and powerful programming paradigms like callbacks and event handling.
