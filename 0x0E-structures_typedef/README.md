# Struct in C Programming

This repository contains files on using structs in C programming. Structs are user-defined data types that allow grouping different variables of different data types under a single name. They provide a way to create custom data structures to hold multiple related pieces of data as a single unit.

The repository includes a C source file illustrating how to define a struct and create variables of that type. It explains how to access individual members of the struct using the dot (.) operator and demonstrates initializing struct variables during declaration.
