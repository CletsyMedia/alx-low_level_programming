# C - Doubly linked lists

A Doubly Linked List is an enhanced data structure that allows for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions, thanks to nodes that contain data and two pointers - one for the next node and one for the previous node. Its versatility makes it a valuable asset in computer science and programming, offering elegant solutions for various data management needs.
