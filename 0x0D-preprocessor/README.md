## Preprocessor

The "0x0D-preprocessor" project explores the fundamental concepts of the C preprocessor. The preprocessor is a powerful tool that allows us to manipulate the source code before it is compiled. By using macros and directives, we can control the behavior of our code and make it more flexible and easier to maintain.

This project contains a collection of C files and header files, each addressing specific preprocessor-related tasks. Each task includes a problem description and requires creating macros or using preprocessor directives to achieve the desired functionality.

## Technologies
- C programming language
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) operating system
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the desired task folder.
3. Compile the C files using the GCC compiler.
4. Run the generated executable to see the output.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CletsyMedia/alx-low_level_programming.git
```
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -o output_file c_file.c
./output_file
```
## Files

The "0x0D-preprocessor" project contains multiple task folders, each with its own set of C files and header files. Each folder represents a specific task that focuses on different aspects of the C preprocessor. The files in this repository include:

1. 0-object_like_macro.h: A header file defining a macro to set a constant value.
2. 1-pi.h: A header file defining a macro for the value of Pi.
3. 2-main.c: A C file using predefined macros to print the name of the source file.
3. 3-function_like_macro.h: A header file defining a function-like macro to compute the absolute value of a number.
4. 4-sum.h: A header file defining a function-like macro to compute the sum of two numbers.
