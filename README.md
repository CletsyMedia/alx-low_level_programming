# The Pathway to C-Programming of ALX Related Tasks

![C Programming](https://easystudyhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/C-progamming.jpg)

The C Programming Language is a computer programming book written by *Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie*.

This repository contains details of the First Sprint of the ALX-SE Programme. This sprint is meant to teach the basic aspects of **C Programming Language** with different topics that are suited for the tasks in this sprint. This repo will contain the solutions to the routine challenges from ALX-SE Programme.
